My research is on the integration of Sequential Decision Making and Learning. I am interested in creating Autonomous Agents that can autonomously learn how to act in a complext environment. Our current approaches involve combining Deep Learning and Symbolic AI mostly focusing on using Reinforcement Learning to learn policies for long-horizon tasks that generalize to more difficult problems. My other research interests include learning symbolic models of the world, which can be used for planning and decision making and creating agents that can understand language instructions.

I did both my Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden. After working a few years as a Software Engineering consultant and doing a research internship at TU Darmstadt, I am now a PhD student in the Machine Reasoning Lab (<a href="https://mrlab.ai/index.html">MRLab</a>) and work on the Representation Learning for Acting and Planning project (<a href="https://rleap-project.github.io/">RLeap</a>) under the supervision of <a href="https://ml.rwth-aachen.de/~hector.geffner/">Hector Geffner</a>.

The easiest way to contact me is via email: martin.funkquist [AT] gmail.com but you can also reach me through the social media links below. I am always happy to discuss my research, potential collaborations, or any other topics of interest.
